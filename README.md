# Project Title: Molecular Vizualization using PYMOL
## Course: Foundations of Bioinformatics (MSc Bioinformatics) 

## Overview
Active Site Visualization of the PmrA–DNA Complex (PDB ID: 4S04)

This project presents a **PyMOL-based molecular visualization** of the active site and DNA-binding interface of the **PmrA response regulator** (PDB ID: **4S04**).  
The visualization highlights structural features and interactions that enable PmrA to bind promoter DNA and regulate polymyxin resistance genes which aids in the understanding of  **antibiotic resistance regulation** in bacteria. This project demonstrates **structural biology visualization skills** and **molecular graphics rendering** using PyMOL.

## 🧬 Background

**PmrA** is a response regulator protein in bacteria that controls gene expression linked to **polymyxin antibiotic resistance**.  
When activated, PmrA binds to promoter DNA and modulates genes responsible for **lipid A modification**, reducing polymyxin binding to bacterial membranes.  
Understanding its structure helps in **drug resistance research** and therapeutic development.
